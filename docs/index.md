# About

Persona Essentials is a set of miscellaneous improvements for Persona 4 Golden (2022) and Persona 5 Royal (PC) based on [Reloaded II](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded-II/).  

# Features

- Support for replacing CPK file contents via other mods.  
- Support for injecting custom music into the game without extracting files.  
- Support for hot reload (update files on the fly without game reboot).  
- Automatically merges most .tbl files.  

## Features (Persona 5 Royal Only)
- Intro Skip.  
- Toggle Pause on Window Focus Loss.  

# Building

- Install [Reloaded II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/releases/latest).  
- Install [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0).  
- [Optional] Download Visual Studio/Rider and open the .sln file.  

When you build your project, the files will automatically be copied to the right directory and be loaded by Reloaded.
